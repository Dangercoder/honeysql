## Other Reference Documentation

The full list of supported SQL clauses is documented in the
[Clause Reference](clause-reference.md). The full list
of operators supported (as prefix-form "functions") is
documented in the [Operator Reference](operator-reference.md)
section. The full list
of "special syntax" functions is documented in the
[Special Syntax](special-syntax.md) section. The best
documentation for the helper functions is in the
[honey.sql.helpers](https://cljdoc.org/d/com.github.seancorfield/honeysql/2.0.0-alpha3/api/honey.sql.helpers) namespace.
If you're migrating to HoneySQL 2.0, this [overview of differences
between 1.0 and 2.0](differences-from-1-x.md) should help.
